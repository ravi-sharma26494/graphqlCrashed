# Quick Look at GraphQL: A Crash Course

## Description

This README provides a quick crash course on GraphQL, highlighting its key concepts and advantages over traditional REST APIs. The goal is to cover the basics of GraphQL, including common types, type definitions, resolvers, and their visualization using Apollo Graph Explorer.

## What is GraphQL and Why Choose it Over REST API?

- GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs.
- Offers a more flexible and efficient way to request data compared to REST.
- Clients can request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.
- Eliminates the need for multiple round-trip requests by allowing batching of queries.
- Facilitates versionless APIs, as clients can request new fields without changes on the server.

## What I Am Trying to Learn

### Basics of GraphQL

- Understand the fundamental concepts of GraphQL schema, types, queries, and mutations.
- Differentiate between scalar types (int, string, boolean) and custom object types.
- Grasp the concept of a root query type for fetching data.

### Common Types in GraphQL

- Learn about common built-in scalar types: Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID.
- Explore composite types like Lists and Object Types.
- Understand how to define custom types to structure data.

### How to Define Types

- Dive into creating custom types with fields and their respective types.
- Define relationships between types using fields and arguments.

### Resolvers and Their Role

- Comprehend the role of resolvers in GraphQL.
- Learn how resolvers fetch data for different fields.
- Understand the connection between fields in the schema and resolver functions.

### Visualizing with Apollo Graph Explorer

- Explore the Apollo Graph Explorer as a visualization tool.
- See how queries and mutations are executed and data is fetched.
- Experiment with querying the GraphQL schema directly in the explorer.
